We do not send marketing you haven't asked for, and we never sell your details.",

      "Your details are shared only where the work requires it: with the payment processor to take a payment, with transporters to deliver a load consigned to you, with professional advisers where a transaction needs them (for example a land transfer), and with authorities where the law requires disclosure. Nothing is shared for advertising.",

    title: "Retention",

      "Enquiries that don't become business are kept for up to two years so we can honour \"contact me when one comes up\" requests, then deleted. Transaction records — weights, waybills, invoices, receipts — are kept for as long as Ghanaian tax and company law requires.",

      `Under Ghana's Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843), you may ask what we hold about you, have inaccuracies corrected, and ask us to delete details we have no legal duty to keep. Call ${siteConfig.phone} or write to ${siteConfig.email} — we answer within a reasonable time, usually the same working week.`,
